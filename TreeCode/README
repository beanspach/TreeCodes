YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT PYTHON IS INSTALLED
To check open command prompt and type: python --version
if you get an error python is NOT installed.
if you get a version number then you are good to continue.

To install dependencies run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
 - move the requirements.txt into your project folder
 - open the command prompt and do cd project folder path
 - pip install -r requirements.txt

ItreeApp is not commented but is very similar to ItreeNOAPP.
ItreeAPP has a gui attached to it where you can select the file through the gui
ItreeNOAPP has no gui and the file you wish to read and the one you want to output to must be modified in the python code.
